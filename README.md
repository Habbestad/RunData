# RunData

### Summary:

RunData is a small c++ library made for extracting data from the .tcx files produced by my Garmin GPS watch. Using Cython, it can easily be compiled to a Python module, which is how I mainly use it. 

Here is an example of a plot in Python (see 'examples.py' in the 'python' folder for the code):

### Documentation:

For an overview take a look in the 'main/include' folder. 

### Disclaimer

This is very much a hobby project in developement. It is probably easy to make it crash. For learning purposes most parts are unnecessesarily (and probably sub-optimally) made from scratch.
